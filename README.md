* Initialie git and add remote origin
* Create a file: `README.md`
* Add new file to git, commit, and push
	
* File: `README.md`

### 1. Coding fury road

Create the following directories in root of project:
* `bash`
* `c`
* `js`
	
Create the following empty files:
* `c/c_is_fun.c`
* `js/main.js`
* `js/index.js`
	
Create the following files with specified contents:
* File: `bash/holberton`
	* Contents: `#!/bin/bash` and `echo "Holberton"`
* File: `bash/school`
	* Contents: `#!/bin/bash` and `echo "School"`
	
Add all to git, commit changes with the following message and push to remote server:
* Commit message: "I'm starting to code, so cool"

### 2. Collaboration is the base of a company

Create a branch, create file, update previously created files, push to the new branch, then update the master branch:
* Branch to create: `update_script`
* New files: `bash/98`
* File to update: `bash/holberton` 
	* Update to: `echo "Holberton School is so cool!"`
Delete directory: `js`

### 3. Collaboration: be up to date

Update `README.md` in Github, get the changes locally, create new file, add the new file
* New file: `up_to_date`
	* Specified commit message: "How to be up to date in git"

### 4. HAAA what did you do???

An example of trying to merge branches with changes in the same file at the same line. 
* Merge branch `update_script` to branch `master`
You'll get the following message:
`CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in bash/holberton`
Resolve the conflicts by using branch `update_script`

### 5. Never push too much

Create a file to never push `~` files (generated by Emacs)
* File: `.gitignore`
